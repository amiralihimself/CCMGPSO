A Java implementation of CCMGPSO, an algorithm for solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo contains a Java implementation of our algorithm CCMGPSO, an algorithm for solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems. This algorithm was born out of our research on large-scale multi-objective problems, and it showed competitive performance for a variety of separable and non-separable problems with many decision variables and two to three objectives. [The findings of our research were published in the Swarm and Evolutionary Computation journal in 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650223000366).
